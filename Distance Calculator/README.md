# Distance Equation 
This code shows different types of calculations in measuring distance between points. The function equations that is created is the ff:
1. [Euclidian distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)
2. [Minkowski distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance#:~:text=The%20Minkowski%20distance%20or%20Minkowski,the%20Polish%20mathematician%20Hermann%20Minkowski.)
3. [Manhattan_distance](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance)
4. [Chebyshev distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance)

The code is one of the basic codes to learn more about the Python language
