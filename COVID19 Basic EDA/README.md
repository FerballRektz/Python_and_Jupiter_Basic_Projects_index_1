# Basic Exploratory Data Analysis of COVID19 Data Project

## I. Objective
to perform a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in the COVID19 dataset

## II. Scope 
The scope of the project can be explained in three short segments:
### a. Defining "Basic EDA"
"Basic EDA" in this my term where the project did not **dwelve deeply in analyzing the data**, this EDA is composed only of plots with no test whether if it is significant or not. This EDA serves as a apporximate visualisation on the statistics of the COVID19 pandemic in 2021.
### b. Timeframe
The basic EDA in this project only encompass the year 2021 
### c. Dataset
there is no basis or links that shows the validity of the dataset, the dataset can be used to practice for doing a EDA analysis 

## III. Data used 
The data that is used in this project is from the COVID19 dataset, there is no link or references that the dataset is obtained. 

The dataset is composed of the ff:<br>
Age = integer, age of a person<br>
Sex = character, biological sex of the person<br>
RegionRes = string, region where the person is lives<br>
HealthStatus = string, outcome of the person due to COVID19<br>
DateOnset = date, date confined<br>
DateRemoval = date, date removed from confinement<br>
Days = intreger, number of days of recovery<br>

## IV. How the code is done
The project is seperated plots in which there are code blocks that focus on each plot, in each of these code blocks it consists on the ff:
### a. Pre-processing
in each codeblocks the dataset is filtered to get the variables needed for plotting
### b. Plotting
after the variables are obtined, the variables are visuazlized through a desired and optimal plot

## V. Result Summary 
The plots show:
- statistics on the recovery rate of COVID19 based on age and gender
- the infectivity and mortality of COVID19 based on gender
- number of cases of COVID19 per month in year 2021

The plots can be used on what sector of the population is more targeted and is more affected by COVID19 and seasons or months that COVID19 cases increase

## VI. Code and Project Reccomendations
there is both code and project reccomendations that needs to be addressed:
1. There should be more detailed plots in the EDA
2. The timeframe of the COVID19 can be extended to more visualize its full effects in the population
3. There should be statsitical test on checking whether the plots you are visualizing are significant or not for a more stronger evidence
