# MY PYTHON PROJECT CODES
Hi guys I am these are my projects in which is divided into two:
1. Basic
2. Advanced  

Basic codes are comprised of codes that take **1-3 days** to complete  
- **The index that is created per basic index is 20**


Advanced codes are comprised in my opinion code that take **3 or more days** to complete that needs ample research on code and project aim data 
- **The index that is created per advanced index is 10**

CURRENT REPOSITORY INFORMATION  
Index no: 1  
Description:  
- This is index 1 of basic python code, this means that this repository will contain first 20 basic python codes for [github optimization](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage)

Current modifications:  
- fixed repository import error (accidentally imported advanced python files to basic repo)
