# REGRESSION TREE BASIC CODE


The code is one of my basic code withn my first year in coding in python, 
, it shows  how the first step in finding the root nodes

The problem of the code is that the regression step is not properly defined and only shows how information gain is calculated and corresponding population standard deviations for each category

## For future code: <br>
- there needs to be an indepth and complete step in doing the regression tree algorithm
- the continous variable age should be ranged and then calculated for its information gain to obtain its significance
