# Using Cluster Plot in Facebook Data
a group project in collaboration with: <br>
FAUSTINE AGUINALDO <br>
LUIS TABIAN <br>
KENT BALUYOT <br>
## I. Objective
create a clusterplot that shows connection of each person through each other in the facebook dataset
## II. Scope 
the data shows how many friends a person has in facebook that shows how "connected"
the person is in facebook. Altough it shows a person connection through facebook, it cannot fully determine if the persons friend in facebook is a genuine connection in real life 
## III. Data Used
The data used is not found in the internet the data is composed of a grid of x and y of the names of the person and with grid cells intersecting them with values 0 and 1, 1 represents that the person is thier friend through facebook and 0 does not
## IV. How the code is done
the code of the project is made through jupiter notebook and its workflow can be explained as one goes through the code
## V. Result Summary
The clusterplot shows the connection each person has through each other. the number of relationhips or facebook friends a person has is connected to how near is the node or circle(with the name of the person) to the center. 
## VI. Code and Project Reccomendations
there is both code and project reccomendations that needs to be addressed:
1.  The code needs to find a way to create a interactive graph of the perons connection in the clusterplot to see a more filtered view of each persons connection through the dataset
1. There should be a code on how many a person is connected to that has many connections of facebook friends
1.  There should be more data or explaination on wheter the number of friend in facebook can mean that the person itself is really well connected
